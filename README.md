# HIV_Interactive_Modeling
Welcome to our project!

Interactive Modeling of Human Immunodeficiency Virus in the United States is a final group project for MAD2502 at UF created by Tyler Audino, Tikiri Ekanayake, Arlen Gyden, and Quinn Yuan in December 2022. 

This interactive tool creates and displays choropleth maps, ANOVA tests, and T-Tests to aid in visualization of HIV data and statistics. This program is intended to aid in identifing areas within the USA which need further attention in the areas of sexual health and HIV prevention. All Data used is from AIDSVu.org

This repo contains the code from this project, as well as our final paper and presentation. 

The main code is in the Jupyter Notebook file: FINALCapstonePresentation.ipynb. Github does not display the choropleth map in our file preview. To view this function, you should downloading and manually run the mapselect() function. We also have a screenshot of the choropleth map in the presentation. 

Thank you for your interest!
